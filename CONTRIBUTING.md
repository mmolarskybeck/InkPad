# Contributing to InkPad

We love your input! We want to make contributing to InkPad as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone your fork of the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmolarskybeck/InkPad.git
cd InkPad
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Make your changes and test them locally

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
3. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined

## Commit Messages

Please use clear and meaningful commit messages:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- A clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want
- Explain why this feature would be useful to most InkPad users
- Include mockups or examples if applicable

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with the "question" label if you have any questions about contributing!
